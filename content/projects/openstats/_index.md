OpenStats is an interactive data exploration platform for Australia, featuring data on crime, demographics, socio-economics, housing and the property market.

I created OpenStats in 2024, drawing on my work as an economist. Through my work I knew there was a lot of data available at the small-area level, but not an easy way to visualise it, which is why I created OpenStats.

Today OpenStats is used by tens of thousands of people every month for a diverse set of reasons. Some of the users include governments, academics, students, non-government organisations, renters, property investors and developers.

The website is built with Next.js and Leaflet, while data processing is done using a combination of Python, R and TypeScript. I've continued to develop the platform since launch, regularly shipping new features and data updates.
